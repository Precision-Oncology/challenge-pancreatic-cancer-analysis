# Challenge: Pancreatic Cancer Analysis

## Overview
This is a coding challenge is designed to test your ability to analyze and data from a real-world pancreatic cancer dataset based on the real-world domain we deal with at Radical Health. The dataset contains longitudinal clinical, genomic, and treatment data for all cancer patients. 

Your overarching task is to build a model to _______.

You may do this at your own pace at home. The time you should spend on this task is 2 hours. The scope of the challenge is designed to take much more than 2 hours and it is very normal to not have finished all your tasks by the end of your time limit. We will schedule a call with Gediminas where we explore your work and thought processes!

## Instructions
Your specific instructions are as follows:
1. Download the dataset from [here](https://cbioportal-datahub.s3.amazonaws.com/msk_chord_2024.tar.gz). This dataset is ~360Mb was published alongside this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08167-5) from MSK. 
2. This dataset contains 24,950 cancer patients, of which only 3,109 are pancreatic cancer patients. Don't forget to filter out the non-pancreatic patients and be sure to delete unneeded files to avoid storage issues.
3. Write scripts to achieve your overarching tasks. (You may use any programming language & any open source libraries you want.)
5. Document all of your work, including exploratory data analyses and thought processes.
6. Delete any unneeded files to avoid storage issues on your local machine.
7. Reach out to Simone and Gediminas when you are ready!

Beyond anything specifically mentioned, feel free to make any assumptions and justify your assumptions to achieve your tasks. 
Note that while we expect submitted code to run, we don't expect it to be ready to deploy! Leaving comments about things you would like to do given more time is totally fine.
